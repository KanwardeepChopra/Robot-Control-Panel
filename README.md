# Robot- Control Panel
 "The Build Robot project is a web application that simulates a grid-based environment where users can control a virtual robot. The objective is to navigate the robot through the grid and reach the destination, which is marked by a red cell. Users can give instructions to the robot by clicking on directional buttons (up, down, right, left) or by dragging and dropping arrow icons onto a logic panel. The robot's movements are recorded in a movement log, providing a history of the instructions implemented.  The interface features a grid with visual representations of the robot's position and the destination cell. The logic panel allows users to arrange arrow icons as instructions for the robot's movements. The site also includes a reset button to restart the robot's position and clear the movement log.  This interactive and engaging web application offers an opportunity to learn and explore basic programming concepts in a playful and intuitive manner. Users can develop their problem-solving skills and enhance their understanding of sequential instructions while enjoying the experience of guiding a virtual robot to its destination."
